# Python-OSEMN-Data-Analysis-Pet-Store-Sales

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow using the OSEMN framework (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, and Interpret) on a real-world dataset from a pet store's sales transactions. The main goal is to clean, explore, and interpret the dataset to extract actionable business insights.

## Objective
The project aims to practice and apply fundamental data analytics skills learned through a course, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and stakeholder-oriented interpretation.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data manipulation and cleaning techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization

## Project Workflow
1. **Obtain**: Loaded sales transaction data of pet products including categories, quantities, and prices.
2. **Scrub**: Cleaned the dataset by removing rows with missing critical values, correcting incorrect entries, handling missing values, and eliminating unnecessary columns.
3. **Explore**: Created new features like subtotal and conducted categorical and numerical analyses to understand sales distribution by product category and line.
4. **Model**: (Not performed in this project) The focus was mainly on data preparation and exploration.
5. **Interpret**: Developed visualizations and communicated insights regarding sales trends and product performance to stakeholders, highlighting key product categories and pricing strategies.

## Key Findings
- Significant sales in specific product categories such as treats and bedding differentiated by product lines (cats and dogs).
- Identified pricing and sales volume trends to prioritize product focus.
- Insights help inform business decisions on inventory prioritization and marketing strategies.

## How to Use This Repository
- Explore the Jupyter notebooks to see the step-by-step data cleaning and analysis process.
- Review the visualizations for insights on sales trends.
- Adapt the methodology to other retail sales datasets or extend the project to include predictive modeling.
